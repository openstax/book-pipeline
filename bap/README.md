## Set of files involved in running enki on all books


### Data

`book_data/USER_ubl.txt` - Unapproved Book List (UBL). User-maintained file. Gives user the option to supply books not in the ABL. When `update_books.rb` runs, it draws from this file as well as the [ABL](https://github.com/openstax/content-manager-approved-books/blob/main/approved-book-list.json).

Format:
```
repo-name-1 book-slug-1
repo-name-1 book-slug-2
...
```

`book_data/AUTO_books.txt` - List of books. Format: same as `USER_ubl.txt`. Autogenerated file. Generated by `update_books.rb`, and combines data from ABL and UBL.

### Scripts

`update_books.rb` - Updates or creates the list of books in `all_books.txt`. Creates and references `abl.json`, and optionally references `unapproved_book_list.txt`. 

`run_big_enki.sh` - Iterates over books in `all_books.txt`, running enki to generate each.

Options:
- --command: A [step or set of steps](../step-config.json) to run on all books . Example: `all-git-pdf`
